In botany, a tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, supporting branches and leaves in most species.
In some usages, the definition of a tree may be narrower, including only woody plants with secondary growth, plants that are usable as lumber or plants above a specified height.
Trees are not a taxonomic group but include a variety of plant "species" that have independently evolved a woody trunk and branches as a way to tower above other plants to compete for sunlight.
In looser senses, the taller palms, the tree ferns, bananas and bamboos are also trees. 
Trees tend to be long-lived, some reaching several thousand years old. The tallest known tree, a coast "redwood" named Hyperion, stands 115.6 m (379 ft) high. Trees have been in existence for 370 million years. 
It is estimated that there are just over 3 trillion mature trees in the world.
